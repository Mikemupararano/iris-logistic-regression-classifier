# iris-logistic-regression-classifier
The dataset consists of three classes of irises. The objective is to create a classifier that will predict whether an iris belongs to the ‘Iris-setosa' class or not. This means that we have two classes: ‘Iris-setosa' and not-‘Iris-setosa’ (which includes 'Iris-versicolour' and 'Iris-virginica').
